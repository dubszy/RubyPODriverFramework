# RubyPODriverFramework
Ruby wrapper framework for Selenium WebDriver using the Page Object Model

## Prerequisites
To use this framework, [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) must be installed.
To check if Ruby and Bundler are installed on your computer, run the following commands in a terminal:
```
which ruby
which bundler
```
To install Ruby on your machine, refer to the documentation [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/).
To install Bundler on your machine, run the following command in a terminal:
```
gem install bundler
```

## Setup
Once Ruby and Bundler are installed, install the Ruby gems for this project by running the following command in a terminal:
```
bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```
In the above example, the path "vendor/bundle" can be replaced with any path of your choosing,
but since this is the default path and is known to work, using a different one is not recommended.

## Building
Build scripts have not been set up yet, though the build system will be using Capistrano.

## Usage
This framework is currently a work-in-progress.
